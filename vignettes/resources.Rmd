The [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/) is a discussion board for asking questions about R, Shiny, and package development. If you have a question about a particular R code issue, we’d recommend starting by creating a reproducible example (or reprex). This will often help as the process of creating an example will help you think about your problem in a way that may help solve it, and will help to capture the problem in a way that will allow others to clearly understand the issue. 

See [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) for more on creating a reprex.

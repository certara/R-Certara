In Lesson 9 we provide a case study of [`RsNLME`](https://certara.github.io/R-RsNLME/), demonstrating an end to end workflow using the suite of R packages and Shiny applications developed by Certara.

### Webinar Overview

The bioequivalence of biosimilars is difficult to prove using traditional NCA approaches due to non-linear PK, or/and long half-life as such a lot of research has been ongoing to conduct a model-based approach.

The model-based approach operation characteristics was studied using a simulation-reestimation approach. 

In this webinar we will cover:

* How to design a simulation re-estimation study
* How to write efficient R and RsNLME workflows that build the dataset, fit the model, conduct the required analysis and collect and compile results
* How to present the results using graphics and tables

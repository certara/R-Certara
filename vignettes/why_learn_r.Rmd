## Why Learn R?

Why should I learn R for pharmacometrics work?  Drug development is filled with uncertainty.  The best plans are routinely invalidated by the newest piece of data.  Analysts need tools that are fit-for-purpose, but also flexible enough to excel in this domain of uncertainty.

R is such a tool and its popularity continues to grow across several disciplines in drug development.  In skilled hands, R and its massive library of support packages provides a means to achieve levels of efficiency, quality, and reproducibility that are difficult if not impossible to achieve with less flexible tools.

R can be difficult to learn.  Certara’s goal is to help users learn R by providing a rich set of tools, packages, and learning resources that ease the learning curve for R in pharmacometrics.
